// We prefer to keep `main.rs` and `lib.rs` separate as it makes it easier to add extra helper

// Whether to make `main.rs` just a thin shim that awaits a `run()` function in `lib.rs`, or
// to put the application bootstrap logic here is an open question. Both approaches have their
// upsides and their downsides. Your input is welcome!
